## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

I start with reviewing the design products, in this case a Figma file with desktop and mobile mock-ups. I'm looking first for low-hanging fruit: colors, typeface, general layout. For larger projects, if the design files don't have a Material Design board already, I'd seriously consider creating one for myself. I've found that this front-end work makes the styling easier down the line. Looking at the designs closely enough to create a MD board also gets me looking at some of the smaller detials.

Next I either clone the respository into a project folder, or I create my own git repository. Rename master to main if it hasn't already been done, create a gitignore to remove packages, certain assests, and anything proprietary from the public repo. Put on some relaxing music, and start VS Code.

In VS Code I first create a boilerplate reset.css file (I use a modified version of [Andy Bell's reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)). From there I create a main.css and begin creating the Custom Properties I'll need for the page by looking at either the Material Design board, or my notes.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) - Josh explains aspects of CSS that have really clicked with me and I'm finding his CSS course challenging, but well worth the expense for the insight he brings.
- [Kevin Powell goes through his CSS process](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel/introduction-co9754ea5b87864fba221a504) - This is a free tutorial on Scrimba, in conjunction with Frontend Mentor that really clicked with me. I liked Kevin's approach to CSS development and hope to adapt my own flow along these lines. I'm now watching more and more of [Kevin's thought process on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw)
